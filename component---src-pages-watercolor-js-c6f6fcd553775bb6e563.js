To fix these issues, we did a slightly simpler formula for computing pigment transfer. Given the fraction of water flowing out of the surface and into the flow layer, we would transfer the same fraction of pigment into the pigment’s flow layer. This made pigment transfer very simple and reliable."),Object(l.a)("p",null,"An additional change made was having a small minimum amount of pigment transferred even in the case of no water flow, but as long as the cell had density and there was pigment to transfer.

Supposedly, the blocking factor is set to the height field of the cell for non-pinned cells. However, we found that the results looked much better if the blocking factors were all kept much lower. To that end, we reduced all blocking factors by a factor of 60, which was arrived at through experimentation."),Object(l.a)("p",null,"The last area that our code could be very different from the ideal model is the brush handling. The papers hardly go into any detail about their implementation, save for using a circular brush and considering pixels fully inside to be under the brush. After trying many methods and refining each iteration, we arrived at a rather complicated shader for the brush. First, it takes the line segment of the current mouse position and the previous mouse position and considers any cell within a threshold distance to be under the brush. This creates a smoother brush and reduces noticeable sampling artifacts. Then, we compute a scaled brush direction, which influences which distribution functions to increase more. The greater the magnitude of the brush vector, the more we increase the corresponding distribution functions. However, no matter the brush vector, we define a minimum amount to increase the distributions by to effect more visible flow in the end result. The surface pigment and water are both increased, with a slight exponential falloff towards the extremities of the brush. A key implementation detail is that none of the values altered by the brush shader are plainly increased. Instead, they are “averaged up” to a certain maximum. This makes the brush application look more even, and eliminates issues with large distribution function values becoming unstable. "),Object(l.a)("p",null,"Various minor edits we made include clamping of values to either ensure they remained non-negative, to ensure they did not grow too large, or to ensure that a minimum value was used. The last two especially are prevalent throughout all the shaders, as a way of controlling values to be within expectations. For example, the pigment deposited onto the fixture layer is clamped to be between 0.003 and less than a percent (depending on various factors) of the total pigment in the flow layer. "),Object(l.a)("p",null,"Debugging was extremely tedious for this project. Not only are all the shaders interdependent, it is very hard to verify intermediate results as our only output is the rendered outcome of the entire pipeline. As a result, trying to pin down the cause of a bug involved lots of manual perturbation to try setting some values to constants, commenting out different blocks of code, writing simplified shaders with easily verifiable behavior to test the other shaders, etc. Essentially, it was one big game of guess and check. Furthermore, the compiler gave very vague error messages, so even syntax errors could take a few minutes to find and solve."),Object(l.a)("p",null,"Lastly, sometimes we would find out that a parameter was off by an order of magnitude or more the entire time, and once we fixed it, things would work but we would need to adjust nearly a dozen other parameters to complement the new value. Adjusting the parameters was especially challenging, as small changes to one of the parameters or the code could warrant hours of testing combinations of the other parameters. We learned that it is not always the case that some complicated method in a paper is correct or that it will produce the best visual results (especially when there are more than 5 hyper parameters involved).
